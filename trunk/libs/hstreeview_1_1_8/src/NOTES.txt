1.1.8 - 2007/02/11

- Fixed bug with in TreeColumn where a Draw() call after having been disposed would raise a null ref error.

1.1.7 - 2007/02/05

- Fixed bug with GetRowOfNode() and added an overload to ScrollTo() so it takes an int.

1.1.6 - 2007/01/24

- Added Re-orderable columns (mostly based on TreeViewAdv code)
- Fixed a bug when navigating with the keyboard when the previously focused node has been removed when right to the top or to the down of the tree.
- Fixed PageUp and PageDown.

1.1.5 - 2007/01/04

- Fixed a TreeViewAdv.ScrollTo() glitch.
- Fixed a bug with the horizontal scrollbar not showing with visible columns.
- Removed AutoRowHeight.

1.1.4 - 2007/01/03

- Fixed a bug with TreeViewAdv.SelectedNodes.

1.1.3 - 2006/12/08

- Fixed a bug with shift-selection when using keyboard.

1.1.2 - 2006/12/06

- Made ExpandAll() and CollapseAll() lazy operations (See on-the-fly fetching tab in SampleApp for an example)
- Removed ITreeModel.IsLeaf. GetChildrenCount has the same role. In cases when you don't want to fetch the children count, but tell that a node is not a leaf, just return -1 (See the FolderBrowser example).
- Lots of bug fixes.


1.1.1 - 2006/11/29

- Fixed SelectNode event, which was broken.
- Fixed RowCount, which was also broken (see comment above TreeRootAdv.RowCount)

1.1.0 - 2006/11/21

- Added on-the-fly node loading. That's a *very nice* feature if you have a lot of rows to display. It prevents the tree to load all rows upfront.
- Changed the way row mapping works. The TreeNodeAdv.Row property no longer exists, and the row map is simply a list of nodes, accessible through GetNodeOfRow() and GetRowOfNode().
- Changed the way selection works. Instead of keeping a list of selected TreeNodeAdv in memory, it just keeps a list of index ranges. *Much* faster when you want to shift-select a lot of rows.
- TreeViewAdv.SelectionMode was changed to TreeViewAdv.AllowMultipleSelection.

1.0.1 - 2006/11/11

- Added the ability for NodeComboBox to draw dropdown arrows even if they're not in edition mode.

1.0.0 - 2006/11/09

- Initial version
