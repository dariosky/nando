HS.Controls.Tree is a fork of TreeViewAdv 1.2.3.0 by Andrey Gliznetsov at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/treeviewadv/.

More information at http://www.hardcoded.net/dotnet/treeview/

HOW TO USE:

This project is a VS 2k5 solution.

Add references to HS.Controls.Tree.dll to your toolbox. This should 
add a "TreeViewAdv" component to it. You will also need to add a reference
to HS.Controls.Tree.Base.dll to your project so you can implement the
ITreeModel interface. See SampleApp for examples.
